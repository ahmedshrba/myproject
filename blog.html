               <p>Your questions does not have a 100% definite answer, however I was researching this last week and came to one straight forward way of explaining this. If you are using display:none, you have a better chance of that element not being rendered by the browser. While if you are using visibility:hidden, the element you are configuring will be preloaded by your browser. Basically, it all depends on how the change takes place in your stylesheet to make the object hidden or shown – and of course which browser/platform/device the user is accessing from.
